AI and Machine Learning Guide

What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning - Learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error

Popular Frameworks:
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn

Applications:
Machine learning is used in various fields including healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles, and natural language processing.
